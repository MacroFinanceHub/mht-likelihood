# Matlab Code for "The Likelihood of Mixed Hitting Times"
## Jaap Abbring and Tim Salimans

This repository contains MATLAB code for replicating the numerical results in Abbring and Salimans (2021). This covers the computation of the likelihood of the mixed hitting-time model (Abbring, 2012), maximum likelihood estimation of parametric versions of this model, and an application to the analysis of Kennan's (1985) strike data.
