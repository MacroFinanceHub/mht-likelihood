# The Likelihood of Mixed Hitting Times
## Jaap Abbring and Tim Salimans

This repository containst the source and pdf files for the paper "The Likelihood of Mixed Hitting Times". Currently, it only contains the LaTeX and BibTeX source files and the data (generated with MATLAB code still stored elsewhere under CVS/SVN) needed to compile the paper submitted to JOE. The next step will be to migrate the MATLAB code as well and bundle it in a proper replication package.
